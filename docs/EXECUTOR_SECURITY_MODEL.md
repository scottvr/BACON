Yes, absolutely. Spec'ing out the secure executor is a critical step and a perfect example of baking in security from day one. A poorly designed executor is the biggest liability in any agentic system.

Here is a detailed specification for a Docker-based sandboxed code executor.

## Secure Code Executor: Component Specification
### üéØ 1. Objective
To create a CodeExecutor module that can run arbitrary Python code generated by an LLM in a manner that is isolated, resource-limited, ephemeral, and incapable of harming the host system or accessing unauthorized data.

### ‚öñÔ∏è 2. Core Principles
Least Privilege: The execution environment will have the absolute minimum permissions required. It will have no network access and no access to the host filesystem outside of a designated directory. It will not run as root.

Ephemerality: Each execution environment will be created for a single, specific task and completely destroyed afterward. No state will persist between runs.

Statelessness: All necessary context (code, data files) must be explicitly passed into the environment at runtime.

Resource Limiting: The environment will be strictly constrained in terms of CPU, memory, and execution time to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) or runaway processes.

### üèóÔ∏è 3. Proposed Architecture & Lifecycle
The CodeExecutor will be a Python module on the host that orchestrates Docker container runs.

Execution Lifecycle:

Request: The Executor receives a task containing the Python code to run and a list of any required input files.

Staging: It creates a temporary, unique directory on the host (e.g., output/runs/{uuid}/).

Provisioning: It copies the input files and the generated Python script (e.g., main.py) into the temporary directory.

Execution: It constructs and executes a docker run command with the strict security parameters detailed below. The command will mount the temporary directory into the container.

Monitoring: The host module captures stdout, stderr, the container's exit code, and monitors the execution time. If the time limit is exceeded, it forcibly terminates the container.

Teardown: Once execution is complete (or terminated), the container is automatically removed (--rm).

Harvesting: The host module reads any result files (e.g., output.csv, result.json) from the temporary directory.

Cleanup (Optional): The temporary directory can be deleted or archived for debugging.

Response: It packages the results (stdout, stderr, exit code, and paths to output files) and returns them to the Executive Planner.

### üìú 4. Dockerfile Specification (bacon-executor/Dockerfile)
The image should be pre-built with common libraries to avoid needing network access for pip install.

```dockerfile
# 1. Use a minimal, trusted base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# 2. Create a non-root user for execution
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash appuser

# 3. Create a working directory
WORKDIR /app

# 4. Pre-install common, trusted libraries.
# This avoids needing network access in the container.
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 5. Switch to the non-root user
USER appuser

# 6. Set the default command
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

A sample requirements.txt might include: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, requests, matplotlib.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Runtime Permissions & Constraints
This is the most critical part. The docker run command must be constructed with the following flags:

--rm: Ephemerality. Automatically removes the container when it exits.

--network=none: Network Isolation. Disables all networking. The LLM cannot "phone home" or access any external or internal services.

--memory="1g": Resource Limiting. Sets a hard memory limit (e.g., 1GB). This should be configurable per task.

--cpus="1.5": Resource Limiting. Limits CPU usage to 1.5 cores.

--read-only: Filesystem Isolation. Mounts the container's root filesystem as read-only. The only writable location will be the mounted volume.

-v "/path/to/output/runs/{uuid}/":/app:rw: Controlled I/O. Mounts the temporary host directory into the container's /app directory with read-write permissions. This is the code's "sandbox."

--user="$(id -u):$(id -g)": Least Privilege. Runs the container process with the same user and group ID as the host user, preventing permission errors on the mounted volume.

--cap-drop=ALL: Least Privilege. Drops all Linux capabilities (e.g., killing other processes, changing network settings).

### üìã 6. Implementation Roadmap
[x] Create the Dockerfile: Define the Dockerfile and a requirements.txt with essential libraries. Build the image locally as bacon-executor:latest.

[x] Develop the CodeExecutor module: Write the Python class that handles the full lifecycle described in section 3. It will use the docker-py library or subprocess to construct and run the docker run command.

[x] Implement I/O handling: Ensure the module can correctly place input files into the temporary directory and retrieve output files after execution.

[x] Add error and timeout handling: Wrap the container execution in a timeout and properly parse different exit codes to determine success, code error, or system error.

[x] Integrate as a Tool: Register the CodeExecutor as a tool that the Executive Planner can invoke. The requires_approval: true flag should be used here by default.
